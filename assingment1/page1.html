  <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <div class="intro">
    <p>Hydrangea, commonly named the hortensia, is a genus of more than 70 species of flowering plants native to Asia and the Americas. By far the greatest species diversity is in eastern Asia, notably China, Korea, and Japan. Most are shrubs 1 to 3 m (3 ft 3 in to 9 ft 10 in) tall, but some are small trees, and others lianas reaching up to 30 m (100 ft) by climbing up trees. They can be either deciduous or evergreen, though the widely cultivated temperate species are all deciduous.The flowers of many hydrangea act as natural pH indicators, sporting blue flowers when the soil is acidic and pink ones when the soil is alkaline.</p></div>

    <p><b><span style="color:rgb(121, 138, 210)">Where the name "Hydrangea" came from....,</span> </b> Well, Hydrangea is derived from Greek and means "water vessel" <b>(from ὕδωρ húdōr "water" + ἄγγος ángos or ἀγγεῖον angeîon "vessel")</b>,in reference to the shape of its seed capsules.The earlier name, Hortensia, is a Latinised version of the French given name Hortense, honoring French astronomer and mathematician "Nicole-Reine Hortense Lepaute".</p>
    <p> <b>Now,Lets talk about the life cycle of these beautiful flower....</b>Hydrangea flowers are produced from early spring to late autumn; they grow in flowerheads (corymbs or panicles) most often at the ends of the stems. Typically the flowerheads contain two types of flowers: small non-showy fertile flowers in the center or interior of the flowerhead, and large, sterile showy flowers with large colorful sepals (tepals). These showy flowers are often extended in a ring, or to the exterior of the small flowers. Plants in wild populations typically have few to none of the showy flowers, while cultivated hydrangeas have been bred and selected to have more of the larger type flowers.

    here are two flower arrangements in hydrangeas with corymb style inflorescences, which includes the commonly grown "bigleaf hydrangea"—Hydrangea macrophylla. Mophead flowers are large round flowerheads resembling pom-poms or, as the name implies, the head of a mop. In contrast, lacecap flowers bear round, flat flowerheads with a center core of subdued, small flowers surrounded by outer rings of larger flowers having showy sepals or tepals. The flowers of some rhododendrons and viburnums can appear, at first glance, similar to those of some hydrangeas.</p>
